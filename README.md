This repository is to document my progress as I go through the 'Approaching (Almost) Any Machine Learning Problem'
by Abhishek Thakur. 

I love this book because it is applied and hands-on, and it's a lot of fun to work on!

I add comments in the scripts where I feel like I needed to do more research to understand some lines
of code and concepts, so I hope that helps anyone who might decide to use this repo for help.
